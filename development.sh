  start [<commit reference>]
    Start Tiamat service in Docker container.

    Optionally, you can pass a commit reference as an argument (like commit SHA
    or its initial substring) to point to a commit (of the
    jore4-docker-compose-bundle repository), which determines the Docker Compose
    bundle version to download. By default, the tip of the main branch is used.

  start:deps [<commit reference>]
    Start the dependencies of jore4-tiamat.
